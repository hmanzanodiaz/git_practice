6. check logs --> git log
7. <git push -u origin master> to commit on github


first time Repository and File
1. mkdir git_practice to make a new directory to practice.
2. cd git_practice to make the new directory your working directory.
3. git init to turn the current, empty directory into a fresh Git repository.
4. echo "Hello Git and GitHub" >> README.txt to create a new README file (more on this later) with some sample text.
5. git add README.txt to add the new file to the Git staging area.
